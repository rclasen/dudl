dudl
====

consists of several parts:
- dudl-grab: grab and encode audio CDs.
- dudl-rename: rename the encoded files and set their Tags.
- dudl-do*: tools helping you to process the files.
- dudl-db: keep track of your music files.

other parts not in this package:
- dudl-www: a cgi frontend to browse the DB.
- dudld: a jukebox daemon that's controlled over the network. It uses the DB.
- dudlc: various clients for connecting to the dudld daemon.

As you process your files with dudl-grab/-encode/... the metadata is
passed in so called job files you are supposed to adjust in your favourite
editor. This means you don't need the Database for these tools to work.


DEPENDENCIES
============

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

basic/rename
 MP3::Tag	debian: libmp3-tag-perl
 MP3::Digest	debian: libmp3-digest-perl	(local)

grab
 dudl-rename
 Net::FreeDB2	debian: libnet-freedb2-perl
 cdparanoia	debian: cdparanoia
 lame		debian-mm: lame

for database
 MP3::Info	debian: libmp3-info-perl
 Gstreamer	debian: libgstreamer-perl
 DBI		debian: libdbi-perl
 DBD::Pg	debian: libdbd-pg-perl
 EzDBI		debian: libezdbi-perl		(local)
 EzDBo		debian: libezdbo-perl		(local)

you may install each module with
 perl -MCPAN -e 'CPAN::Shell->install("<name>")'

IIRC Net::FreeDB2 has minor problems with some results retrieved from
freedb. I've solved this by hacking the .pm


INSTALLATION
============

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

Database
========

a1) keep default ident-based pg_hba.conf
- add Postgres users for all who are granted access to the DB
 CREATE USER <user>;
- add them to the dudl group to give them write access to the DB:
 ALTER GROUP dudl ADD USER <user>;

a2) authenticate on DB connect.
- change all "local" lines in pg_hba.conf to:

# keep the following line for debian maintenance:
local   all     postgres                ident sameuser
# switch to password authentication for local connects:
local   all     all                     md5

- create ~root/.dudlrc that's used by cron jobs:
 echo "db_user=dudl" >> ~root/.dudlrc
 echo "db_pass=dudl" >> ~root/.dudlrc

- everything else is preconfigured.

b) the actual Database is created (and updated) with dudl-dbupdate

Once installed please continue reading Dudl::Overview.
