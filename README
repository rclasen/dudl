needed perl libs:

basic
 MP3::Tag	debian: libmp3-tag-perl		(local)
 MP3::Digest	debian: libmp3-digest-perl	(local)

for database
 MP3::Info	debian: libmp3-info-perl
 DBI		debian: libdbi-perl
 DBD::Pg	debian: libdbd-pg-perl

you may install each module with
 perl -MCPAN -e 'CPAN::Shell->install("<name>")'


Database access:
================

a) keep default ident-based pg_hba.conf 
- add Postgres users for all who are granted access to the DB
 CREATE USER <user>;
- add them to the dudl group to give them write access to the DB:
 ALTER GROUP dudl ADD USER <user>;

b) authenticate on DB connect. 
- change all "local" lines in pg_hba.conf to:

# keep the following line for debian maintenance:
local   all     postgres                ident sameuser
# switch to password authentication for local connects:
local   all     all                     md5

- everything else is preconfigured.


Database installation:
======================

cd tables
make # ... and follow the instructions

of course you can alter the Makefile to do this automatically ;-)
